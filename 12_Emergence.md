# 12-) Emergence

### A design is simple:
-  Runs all the tests
-  Contains no duplication
-  Express intent of programmer
-  Minimizes the number of classes and methods

### For each few lines of code we add, we pause and reflect on new design. Did we just degrade it?

>## The fact that we have these tests eliminates the fear that cleaning up the code will break it.

>## The cleaner the author can make code, the less time others will have to spend understanding it.

>## We want to able to hear a class or function name not be surprised when we discover its responsibilities.

### As systens become more complex, they take more and more time for a developer to understand.

> The majority of the cost of a software project is in long-term maintanence.
