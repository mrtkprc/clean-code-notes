# 13-) Concurrency

Correct concurrency is complex, even for simple problems.

Keep your concurrency-related code seperate from other codes.

Take data encapsulation to heart, severly limit access of any data that may be shared.

Keep your synchronized sections as small as possible.

Run your threaded code and all target platofrms early and often.
